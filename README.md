# CS-210

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project involves developing an object-oriented C++ application for Chada Tech that displays two clocks simultaneously, a 12-hour clock and a 24-hour clock. The problem solved by this project is the need for an application that supports both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.  The application allows users to view and interact with both clock formats, enhancing usability and accessibility.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I made the user interaction partially well. The application allows user input to manipulate and view both clock formats. The code also includes validation for user input to prevent invalid data entry and potential security issues.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance the code by implementing a real time update feature to simulate an actual ticking clock would make the application more realistic. Creating a graphical representation of the clocks would improve user experience as well. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
One of the most challenging parts was managing the conversion between 12-hour and 24-hour formats while ensuring the application remains intuitive for users. To overcome this, I used clear and concise functions for time conversion and thorough testing to validate the functionality. The textbook and online resources provided additional support when struggling with this part of the code.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
One of the most important skills I can take from this project that will help with other projects or course work is modular programming. The skill of breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable functions will be useful in any software development task. Another skill I learned from this project is user input validation, ensuring secure and valid user inputs is important for developing future reliable applications.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By adding inline comments throughout the code to explain the functionality and logic made it easier for others to understand and maintain. I also used consistent naming conventions, variables and functions were named consistently and descriptively, enhancing code readability.
